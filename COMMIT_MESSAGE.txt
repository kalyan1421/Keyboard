fix(theme): Replace all hardcoded colors with dynamic theme system for AI panels

## Problem
AI feature panels (Grammar, Tone, AI Assistant, Clipboard) were displaying
static colors from XML resources instead of dynamically applying the active
keyboard theme. This caused:
- Red backgrounds on panels (from fallback color)
- Inconsistent colors between keyboard and panels
- Panels not updating when theme changed
- Poor user experience with color mismatches

## Root Cause
1. XML layouts used static @color/ references (kb_panel_bg, kb_toolbar_bg)
2. Kotlin code only partially applied theme colors
3. Buttons were not being styled programmatically
4. No MethodChannel to receive theme updates from Flutter

## Solution

### Kotlin Changes
- Enhanced ThemeManager with 6 unified color accessor methods
- Updated inflateGrammarBody() to style all 4 buttons + output TextView
- Updated inflateToneBody() to style all 5 buttons + output TextView  
- Updated inflateAIAssistantBody() to style all 5 buttons + output TextView
- Enhanced inflateClipboardBody() with header title theming
- Enhanced showFeaturePanel() to theme back button and panel body
- Enhanced applyThemeToPanels() to update all buttons on theme change
- Added updateTheme MethodChannel handler in MainActivity
- Updated ClipboardPanel to use ThemeManager accessors
- Documented intentional hardcoded colors in SwipeKeyboardView

### XML Changes
- Removed @color/kb_panel_bg from panel_feature_shared.xml root
- Removed @color/kb_toolbar_bg from panel_feature_shared.xml header
- Changed all static backgrounds to @android:color/transparent
- Updated action_button_background.xml to use theme-aware colors
- Fixed keyboard_key_preview.xml to use kb_text_primary

### Flutter Changes
- Enhanced theme_manager.dart to send specific color values via MethodChannel
- Updated _notifyAndroidKeyboardThemeChange() to invoke updateTheme

## Impact
✅ All 4 AI panels now match keyboard theme exactly
✅ Theme changes apply instantly without reopening panels
✅ 20+ buttons now dynamically styled
✅ No more red backgrounds or color mismatches
✅ Consistent theming across entire keyboard
✅ Improved user experience
