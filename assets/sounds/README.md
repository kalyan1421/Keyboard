# Sound Assets

This directory contains sound files for keyboard feedback:

- `key_press.wav` - Standard key press sound
- `space_press.wav` - Space bar press sound  
- `enter_press.wav` - Enter key press sound
- `special_key_press.wav` - Special keys (shift, delete, etc.) press sound

Note: The app will use system sounds as fallback if these files are not present.

To add custom sounds:
1. Place .wav files in this directory
2. Ensure they are short (< 100ms) for responsive feedback
3. Keep file sizes small for app performance
